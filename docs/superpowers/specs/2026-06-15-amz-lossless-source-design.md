# AmzSource — amz.squid.wtf Amazon Music lossless source — Design

**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Status:** Implemented (all code tasks committed; on-device E2E pending)
**Author:** brainstorm session

## Verification results (live recon 2026-06-15)

Ran the full flow against `amz.squid.wtf` from a residential network (minted a
real token via the PBKDF2 PoW → search → track → stream). Answers the Phase-0
recon questions:

- **Captcha PoW (PBKDF2) confirmed live** — challenge→solve→verify returned a
  token; `AmzAltchaSolver` solves the live challenge (counter ~436), not just the
  HAR vector. search/track/stream all returned 200 with the token.
- **`/api/stream` does NOT honor HTTP Range** — a `Range: bytes=0-1023` request
  returned `200` (full body, `Content-Length` ~32 MB), no `Accept-Ranges` /
  `Content-Range`. So progressive start + in-buffer seek work, but a far-ahead
  seek re-fetches from the start. This is the documented server ceiling; the
  client design is unchanged (no disk cache, OkHttpDataSource progressive).
- **`/api/track` exposes NO duration and NO format/tier field** — metadata keys:
  album, album_artist, album_asin, artist, asin, composer, copyright, cover,
  cover_candidates, cover_cdn, date, disc_*, genre, is_explicit, isrc, label,
  lyrics, title, track_*, year. Confirms the matcher cannot use duration and we
  cannot pre-gate on format → `AudioFormat(flac,0,0,0)` + post-download probe,
  as designed.
- **Stale/invalid `x-captcha-token` returns HTTP 403 (not 401)** — the
  interceptor's `STALE_CODE` was corrected to 403 (commit after recon). Safe:
  amz streams via its own routing branch, not `RefreshingDataSource` (whose
  403/410 trigger is YouTube-only).

## Summary

Add `amz.squid.wtf` (an Amazon Music downloader) as a new lossless source in
Stash, providing **download + streaming** of FLAC. It slots **after**
kennyy/squid and **before** the YouTube fallback in both the download
(`LosslessSourceRegistry`) and streaming (`StreamSourceRegistry`) chains.

Why it matters: amz is backed by **Amazon Music**, so it is *structurally
independent* of the Qobuz `app_id` that kennyy and squid both share. When the
Qobuz proxies degrade or miss a track, amz is a genuine independent lossless
fallback rather than another view of the same backend (which is why monochrome
— a kennyy wrapper — was rejected). It is the third leg the lossless-redundancy
roadmap has been after.

amz is the **same operator/CDN family as `qobuz.squid.wtf`** (`server:
edgedragon`, not Cloudflare), and uses the **same ALTCHA PBKDF2 captcha
scheme**, so Stash's existing PoW solver is reused.

## Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- Resolve a Stash track to an Amazon Music FLAC and (a) download it to the
  library and (b) stream it in online mode.
- Auto-solve the captcha headless (no login, no WebView, no user setup).
- Fail over cleanly (existing health-gate + rate-limiter) when amz misses, is
  down, or is region-gated.

**Non-goals (YAGNI for v1)**
- No multi-region UI (hardcode `country=US`, `tier=best`).
- No dedicated Settings screen / Connect screen (it "just works" like kennyy).
- No ingestion of amz's synced LRC lyrics into Stash's lyrics system (the
  metadata is available; wiring it is a separate future task).
- No DB schema changes.

## API contract (captured from HAR, 2026-06-15)

Host: `https://amz.squid.wtf`. Server header: `edgedragon`. Auth on every API
call: an `x-captcha-token` request header.

### Captcha (ALTCHA PBKDF2 — same scheme as qobuz.squid.wtf)
- `GET /api/captcha/challenge` →
  `{"parameters":{"algorithm":"PBKDF2/SHA-256","cost":1000,"keyLength":32,"keyPrefix":"…","nonce":"…","salt":"…"},"signature":"…"}`
  **Note: NO `expiresAt` field** (qobuz.squid.wtf's challenge *does* have one).
- `POST /api/captcha/verify` body
  `{"payload":"<base64 of {challenge:{parameters,signature},solution:{counter,derivedKey,time}}>"}`
  → `{"token":"<token>"}`
- The returned `token` is sent as the `x-captcha-token` header on all
  subsequent calls.

### Catalog
- `POST /api/search` body `{"query":"<artist> <title>","country":"US","content_type":"TRACK","limit":25}`
  → `{"trackList":[{"asin","title","primaryArtistName","artistName","albumArtistName","album":{"title","image"}}]}`.
  **Search results carry no ISRC and no duration.**
- `POST /api/track` body `{"asin":"<ASIN>","tier":"best","country":"US"}`
  → `{"metadata":{"asin","title","artist","album","album_asin","cover","cover_cdn","year","date","track_number","disc_number","genre","composer","copyright","label","isrc","is_explicit","lyrics":{"synced":"…"}}}`.
- `GET /api/stream?asin=<ASIN>&country=US&tier=best`
  → `application/octet-stream` (the FLAC bytes, served directly from
  amz.squid.wtf; ~56 MB observed for a 4-min track = real hi-res FLAC).
- `GET /api/image?url=<amazon cover url>` → image proxy. **Not used** — the
  search/track responses already give direct public `m.media-amazon.com` URLs.

## Architecture & components

New package `data/download/.../lossless/amz/`, mirroring the `qobuz`/`squid`
layout. Each unit has one purpose and a small, testable interface.

| Component | Responsibility | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| `AmzCaptchaClient` | `GET /api/captcha/challenge` → `AmzAltchaSolver.solve()` → `POST /api/captcha/verify` → returns token string. Uses the BARE shared client (no interceptor) so minting never recurses. | `NativeSquidCaptchaSolver` (pattern only) |
| `AmzAltchaSolver` | The PoW. **Real PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (amz's `algorithm` = `"PBKDF2/SHA-256"`): `PBKDF2(nonceBytes‖uint32_BE(counter), salt, iterations=cost, dkLen=keyLength)`, matched on `keyPrefix`. **NOT** squid's iterated-truncated-SHA256 — verified against a live HAR vector (counter=563), test-locked. | none (squid's `AltchaSolver` does a different derivation and does not work for amz) |
| `AmzCaptchaInterceptor` | OkHttp interceptor scoped to `amz.squid.wtf` (bypasses `/api/captcha/*`); attaches `x-captcha-token`; single-flight (`Mutex`) mint; on a stale-token response, re-mints once and retries. Holds the token `@Volatile`. Registered on the SHARED client via a `Set<Interceptor>` multibinding (see Requirement 3) so the API client, the download fetch, and the streaming data source all get auth from one seam. | `SquidWtfCaptchaInterceptor` |
| `AmzApiClient` | `search()`, `track(asin)`, `streamUrl(asin)`; uses the shared OkHttp client (the multibound `AmzCaptchaInterceptor` attaches/re-mints the token). | `QobuzApiClient` |
| `AmzApiModels` | `@Serializable` DTOs for search/track responses + lenient `Json`. | `QobuzApiModels` |
| `AmzMatcher` | Scores search candidates against the `TrackQuery` (artist+title); picks the best ASIN; confirms via `/api/track` (ISRC match when available). | `MatchScorer` logic |
| `AmzSource : LosslessSource` | `id="amz"`, `displayName="Amazon Music (amz.squid.wtf)"`; the resolve flow; returns `SourceResult`. | `QobuzSource` |
| `AmzStreamResolver` | Streaming adapter: returns `StreamUrl(url = /api/stream, origin = "amz")`; origin propagates to the MediaItem stream-origin extra. | `QobuzStreamResolver` |
| amz routing branch | New `origin == "amz"` predicate + `amzStreamingFactory` in `StashMediaSourceFactory`; its HTTP layer is a Media3 `OkHttpDataSource` (new artifact `media3-datasource-okhttp`) on the interceptor-bearing client. Progressive, no `RefreshingDataSource`, no disk cache. | the existing YouTube routing branch |
| `AmzModule` (Hilt) | `@Binds @IntoSet` `AmzSource` into `Set<LosslessSource>`; provides client/interceptor. | `qobuz` DI |

**Wiring**
- Download: registered into `Set<LosslessSource>`; `"amz"` appended to
  `LosslessSourcePreferences.DEFAULT_PRIORITY` (currently `squid_qobuz`,
  `kennyy_qobuz`) as the last lossless entry — i.e. after both Qobuz proxies,
  before the YouTube fallback.
- Streaming: `AmzStreamResolver` added to `StreamSourceRegistry`'s **normal**
  branch, after `squid` and before `youtube` (NOT in the forceYt branch).
- Both paths gated by the existing `LosslessSourceHealthGate` and
  `AggregatorRateLimiter` (new conservative `configs["amz"]`).
- No DB changes; no Settings UI.

## Data flow

### Captcha mint (shared by all amz calls)
1. `AmzCaptchaInterceptor` sees an `amz.squid.wtf` request with no/stale token.
2. Under a **single-flight Mutex**, `AmzCaptchaClient`:
   `GET /api/captcha/challenge` → `AltchaSolver.solve(params)` →
   `POST /api/captcha/verify` → `{token}`.
3. Token cached `@Volatile`; attached as `x-captcha-token`. Concurrent callers
   await the in-flight solve rather than each solving.

### Download (`AmzSource.resolve(query)`)
1. `isEnabled()` (not circuit-broken) and `rateLimiter.acquire("amz")`; else null.
2. `AmzApiClient.search("<artist> <title>")` (NEVER by ISRC — see Requirement 2).
3. `AmzMatcher` scores `trackList` on artist+title, picks the top candidate.
4. `AmzApiClient.track(asin)` → confirm match: when `query.isrc != null`,
   require `metadata.isrc == query.isrc` for confidence ≥ 0.95; otherwise use the
   fuzzy artist+title score. Reject on duration mismatch if duration is exposed.
5. Return `SourceResult(sourceId = "amz", downloadUrl = streamUrl(asin),
   downloadHeaders = {}, format = AudioFormat(codec = "flac", bitrateKbps = 0,
   sampleRateHz = 0, bitsPerSample = 0), confidence, coverArtUrl = direct
   m.media-amazon cover, sourceTrackId = asin)`.
6. The amz download fetch must carry a *fresh* `x-captcha-token` at fetch time
   (see Requirement 3 — this is **new plumbing**, not the existing static-header
   path). Post-download, the existing `AudioDurationExtractor`/quality probe sets
   the authoritative bits/sample-rate and the duration backstop validates the
   file.

### Streaming (`AmzStreamResolver.resolve(track)`) — progressive, dedicated routing branch

`AmzStreamResolver` returns a `StreamUrl(url = "/api/stream?asin=…", origin =
"amz", …)` — the bytes URL itself, NOT a pre-downloaded local file — and the
resolved origin propagates to the playing `MediaItem`'s stream-origin extra
(the same path kennyy/squid/youtube use).

**Reality of the player routing (confirmed against the code):**
`StashMediaSourceFactory.createMediaSource` routes via the `streamingTrackId`
predicate — **only YouTube-origin** items go through the
`StreamingMediaSourceFactory` chain (`CacheDataSource → RefreshingDataSource →
HTTP`); **everything else, including kennyy/squid lossless, plays via the plain
`DefaultMediaSourceFactory`** (a `DefaultHttpDataSource` GET of the *signed* CDN
URL — progressive, no cache, no refresh). So there is no automatic cache
pipeline to "inherit," and the `RefreshingDataSource` 403/410 URL-refresh
trigger is YouTube-only.

**amz gets its own dedicated routing branch** in `StashMediaSourceFactory`
(net-new wiring — this is the central streaming task):
- A new predicate detects an `origin == "amz"` streaming item (mirroring how
  `streamingTrackId` reads the stream-origin extra), routing it to a new
  `amzStreamingFactory`.
- `amzStreamingFactory` is a `MediaSource.Factory` whose HTTP layer is a Media3
  **`OkHttpDataSource` built on the `AmzCaptchaInterceptor`-bearing client**
  (add the `androidx.media3:media3-datasource-okhttp` artifact — a genuinely new
  dependency at the existing `media3` 1.9.x version; the base `media3-datasource`
  is already present but the okhttp module is separate). The interceptor
  attaches `x-captcha-token` and does re-mint-and-retry on the stale-token
  response for **every** request ExoPlayer issues (initial + each range/seek),
  so mid-stream token expiry is transparent and the auth logic is **shared with
  the download path** (one interceptor, one seam).
- amz deliberately does **not** go through `RefreshingDataSource`. That layer
  re-resolves on 403/410 to mint a new *URL*; amz's auth is a header, not a URL,
  so URL-refresh is wrong for it. Keeping amz on its own branch means the
  interceptor is the *sole* re-auth mechanism and there is **no 403-vs-token
  collision** regardless of whether amz signals stale tokens with 401 or 403
  (Verify-on-device #2 only sets the interceptor's trigger code).
- No disk `CacheDataSource` layer for amz: lossless files are large (~56 MB) and
  kennyy/squid already stream lossless without disk-caching. amz matches that —
  progressive in-memory buffering, with seeks served from the player buffer and,
  for far-ahead seeks, a fresh Range request.

Result: **instant-start progressive playback** (no full-file pre-wait),
consistent with how kennyy/squid lossless already streams, plus authed access
and mid-stream re-mint. Seek-ahead responsiveness beyond the buffer is bounded
by whether `/api/stream` honors Range (server ceiling, Verify-on-device #1) —
not by the client design. Cache-to-local-then-play is explicitly rejected (it
would add a 56 MB pre-play wait for no benefit).

## Design requirements (folded-in critique)

1. **Verify-payload field-set must match amz exactly.** Do NOT reuse
   `NativeSquidCaptchaSolver`'s fixed-field payload builder (it includes
   `expiresAt`, which amz omits). `AmzCaptchaClient` must re-embed amz's
   `parameters` block **verbatim** (preserve the raw JSON substring) and only
   append the `solution`, or the server's HMAC `signature` check fails.
   `AltchaSolver.solve()` is reused unchanged (PoW needs only
   salt/nonce/cost/keyLength/keyPrefix).
2. **Search by text, never by ISRC.** amz `/api/search` indexes a text query;
   ISRC search returns nothing. amz must build its own `"<artist> <title>"`
   query and use ISRC only for `/api/track` confirmation — it must NOT call
   `TrackQuery.searchTerms()` (which emits the bare ISRC when present).
3. **Re-mint at fetch time, not resolve time — and this is NEW plumbing.** A
   token snapshotted into `SourceResult.downloadHeaders` at resolve can expire
   before a queued sync download runs. **The existing download path cannot do
   this:** `LosslessUrlDownloader` uses one shared `OkHttpClient` and applies
   `downloadHeaders` as static headers — there is no per-source interceptor.
   v1 must add the seam. Recommended approach: register `AmzCaptchaInterceptor`
   (host-scoped — a no-op for any host other than `amz.squid.wtf`) on the
   **shared** `OkHttpClient` via Hilt, so both `AmzApiClient`'s calls AND
   `LosslessUrlDownloader`'s fetch get the token attached and auto-re-minted on a
   stale-token response, with no header snapshot. (A host-scoped interceptor is
   safe on the shared client by construction — it never touches Spotify/YouTube/
   Last.fm requests.) The streaming path reuses the *same* interceptor via a
   Media3 `OkHttpDataSource` (see Streaming), so token-attach + re-mint logic
   lives in exactly one place for both download and playback. The plan must
   treat this as net-new wiring, not reuse.
4. **Single-flight captcha mint.** Guard minting with a `Mutex` so parallel
   resolves share one PoW solve instead of stampeding (PBKDF2 cost=1000 is real
   CPU).
5. **Do not assume 24-bit FLAC.** `tier:"best"` returns whatever that track's
   max is on Amazon (may be 16-bit FLAC, or lossy for Atmos/AAC-only titles).
   Set `AudioFormat(codec = "flac", bitrateKbps = 0, sampleRateHz = 0,
   bitsPerSample = 0)` and let the post-download quality probe set authoritative
   values; if `/api/track` states
   a format/tier, use it to pre-reject lossy before downloading so the
   `minQuality=LOSSLESS` gate isn't wasted on a 56 MB fetch.
6. **Cancellation hygiene.** `AmzSource.resolve` / `AmzStreamResolver.resolve`
   re-throw `CancellationException` before any `catch (Exception)` (so worker
   cancellation doesn't surface as a false failure).

## Error handling & failover

- Any amz failure (no token, search miss, no confident match, network error,
  HTTP error) → `resolve` returns null → registry advances to the next source
  (kennyy/squid already tried first; YouTube next). amz never surfaces a hard
  error to the user.
- 429 → `rateLimiter.reportRateLimited("amz")`; other failures →
  `reportFailure`; success → `reportSuccess`. Repeated failures trip the
  circuit breaker; the `LosslessSourceHealthGate` also skips amz during a
  content-degradation cooldown.
- Captcha solve failure → treated as a transient miss (null), not a permanent
  disable; the next resolve retries.

## Rate limiting & health

- New `AggregatorRateLimiter` `configs["amz"]`: conservative defaults (e.g. ~1
  token / 2s, small burst). The captcha challenge/verify round-trips are auth
  overhead and should not themselves trip the catalog rate-limit (decided in
  the plan; default: do not count them).
- Reuses `LosslessSourceHealthGate` for degradation cooldown, identical to
  kennyy/squid/qobuz.

## Testing strategy

- `AltchaSolver`: already unit-tested; reused as-is (no new PoW tests).
- `AmzCaptchaClient`: MockWebServer — challenge (with **no `expiresAt`**) →
  verify; **lock the verify payload bytes against the captured amz HAR vector**
  (the field-set/order that produced a 200 + token). Test single-flight (one
  solve under concurrent callers).
- `AmzCaptchaInterceptor`: re-mint-once-and-retry on a stale-token response;
  no infinite loop on repeated failure.
- `AmzApiClient` + `AmzApiModels`: parse real captured search/track JSON.
- `AmzMatcher`: ISRC-confirm path (high confidence), fuzzy fallback, and
  wrong-version rejection.
- `AmzSource`: gating (disabled/circuit-broken → null), 429 handling,
  cancellation re-throw, `SourceResult` shape.
- Registry wiring tests: amz appears after squid, before youtube, in both
  registries; absent from the forceYt branch.

## Verify-on-device (do early in implementation — they decide details)

1. **Does `/api/stream` honor HTTP Range?** Progressive start + seek-from-cache
   work regardless; Range determines how responsive *seek-ahead beyond cached
   bytes* is. If Range is absent, a far-ahead seek re-fetches from the start
   (cache softens it). Check early; it tunes UX, it does not gate the design.
2. **What does a stale/invalid `x-captcha-token` return?** (401 vs 403 vs 200+
   error body) — sets the interceptor's re-mint trigger. (No collision with
   `RefreshingDataSource` either way, since amz streams on its own routing branch
   that doesn't use it.)
3. **Does `/api/track` expose duration and/or the available format/tier?** —
   enables the duration backstop on match and pre-download lossy rejection
   (Requirement 5).

## Open questions / risks

- Token TTL is unknown; the re-mint-on-stale design tolerates any TTL, but a
  very short TTL would mean frequent PoW solves (cost=1000 PBKDF2 is ~hundreds
  of ms). Acceptable; single-flight bounds the cost.
- Streaming needs a NEW dedicated routing branch in `StashMediaSourceFactory`
  (the cache/refresh pipeline is YouTube-only; lossless uses the plain default
  factory today). amz's branch uses a Media3 `OkHttpDataSource` (new artifact
  `media3-datasource-okhttp`) on the interceptor client — progressive, authed,
  no `RefreshingDataSource`, no disk cache. `StreamUrl` needs no header field
  (auth rides the interceptor; routing keys on the stream-origin extra).
- Seek-ahead responsiveness is bounded by whether `/api/stream` honors Range
  (server-side ceiling, verified early) — not by the client design.
- Amazon US catalog gaps differ from Qobuz — expected and desirable (that is the
  independence), handled by failover.

## Out of scope (explicit)

Lyrics ingestion, multi-region setting, Settings UI/Connect screen, DB changes,
and any change to kennyy/squid behavior.
