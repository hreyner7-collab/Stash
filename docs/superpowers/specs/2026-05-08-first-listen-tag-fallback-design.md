# v0.9.19 — First Listen Tag-Fallback

**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Status:** Design
**Branch:** `feat/first-listen-tag-fallback` (worktree path: `.worktrees/first-listen-tag-fallback`)

## Problem

In v0.9.16 the Stash Mix surface expanded from a single "Stash Discover" flagship to three recipes:

| Recipe | Seed strategy | `discoveryRatio` | Library fallback chain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily Discover | `ARTIST_SIMILAR` | 0.4 (40% discovery) | persona → listening events → top artists by track count |
| Deep Cuts | `NONE` | 0.0 (pure library) | n/a — uses library directly |
| **First Listen** | **`TAG_GRAPH`** | **1.0 (100% discovery)** | **none** |

Real user observation on a v0.9.18 release build with a vast library: Daily Discover and Deep Cuts populate normally; **First Listen is empty**.

Trace of `StashMixRefreshWorker.queueDiscoveryForRecipe` for First Listen:

```
topTags = mixGenerator.computeUserTopTags(limit = 10)
  └─ buildUserTagAffinityVector()
        ├─ listening_events from last 180d  ← user has plays, OK
        ├─ for each row: trackTagDao.getByTrack(trackId).filter { it.tag != "__untaggable__" }
        │  └─ returns empty for tracks not yet enriched, or tracks Last.fm has no real tags for
        └─ if all per-play tag maps end up empty → user vector is empty
      → returns []
candidates = seedGenerator.generate(TAG_GRAPH, topTags = [], …)
  └─ generateTagGraph([]).also { for (tag in [].take(10)) { … } } → []
if (candidates.isEmpty()) return  ← early exit, no discovery queued
discoveryRatio = 1.0 means 0% library fill → mix stays empty
```

Concretely: when the user has listening events but their listened-to tracks aren't yet enriched by `TagEnrichmentWorker` (which runs daily, batches of 200, so a multi-thousand-track library takes many days to fully enrich), the listening-affinity vector is empty. The user's library *itself* contains tagged tracks (visible via `TrackTagDao.getTagHistogram()`) — but no path consumes that signal for the TAG_GRAPH seed.

This is a contained design gap, not a regression. v0.9.16 shipped with no fallback for empty `topTags`.

## Goals

- A v0.9.18 user with a vast library and any subset of enriched tracks has a non-empty First Listen mix after the next `StashMixRefreshWorker` run.
- The fallback uses on-device data already produced by the enrichment pipeline — no extra Last.fm round-trips at refresh time, no UI changes, no preference flips.
- The semantic of First Listen ("Tracks you've never heard. Wider net.") is preserved — the fallback's input is still a "what kind of music does this user like" signal, just sourced from library breadth instead of recent listening.
- The fix is contained to one function in `MixGenerator`; tests live in the same file's existing test class.

## Non-goals

- **No tweak to `TagEnrichmentWorker`'s throughput.** Its 200-tracks-per-day cadence is a separate optimization concern. The fallback handles the gap until enrichment catches up; widening enrichment's bandwidth is a future YAGNI revisit.
- **No new prefs.** The fallback fires automatically whenever `buildUserTagAffinityVector()` returns empty; no opt-in toggle.
- **No `MixGenerator.computeUserTopTags()` signature change.** Same suspending fn, same return type, same caller invocations.
- **No change to other recipes.** Daily Discover and Deep Cuts already have working fallback paths; touching them risks regressing what works.
- **No spec for "the user's listened tracks aren't getting enriched fast enough."** That's a different bug class. This spec only fixes the dead-end when the listening-affinity vector is empty.
- **No tag deduplication / canonicalization.** Library histogram tags ship as-is; whatever Last.fm returned (lowercased and stored) is what we use. Future cleanup is out of scope.
- **No `__untaggable__` sentinel cleanup.** The filter at the consumer is sufficient.

## Design

### 1. Code change

**One function modified.** `core/data/src/main/kotlin/com/stash/core/data/mix/MixGenerator.kt`:

```kotlin
/**
 * v0.9.16: Top-N user tags ordered by tag-affinity weight. Used by
 * [com.stash.core.data.sync.workers.StashMixRefreshWorker] to drive
 * the TAG_GRAPH seed strategy.
 *
 * v0.9.19: when the listening-affinity vector is empty (fresh install,
 * recently played tracks not yet enriched, etc.) falls back to the
 * library-wide tag histogram. The histogram represents "what kind of
 * music this user collects" — the right anchor for First Listen's
 * "wider net" semantics when there's no per-play signal yet.
 *
 * Returns an empty list ONLY when the user has zero tags anywhere in
 * `track_tags` (truly fresh install, enrichment hasn't run a single
 * batch yet) — at which point TAG_GRAPH-driven recipes correctly
 * stay empty until the user's library has any tag data.
 */
suspend fun computeUserTopTags(limit: Int = 10): List<String> {
    val vector = buildUserTagAffinityVector()
    if (vector.isNotEmpty()) {
        return vector.entries
            .sortedByDescending { it.value }
            .take(limit)
            .map { it.key }
    }
    return trackTagDao.getTagHistogram()
        .asSequence()
        .filter { it.tag != "__untaggable__" }
        .take(limit)
        .map { it.tag }
        .toList()
}
```

The fallback's filter mirrors the same `__untaggable__` exclusion `buildUserTagAffinityVector` applies to per-play tags, so neither path can leak the sentinel into seed input.

### 2. Test surface (TDD)

| Test | What it asserts |
|---|---|
| `computeUserTopTags returns affinity-vector tags when vector is non-empty` | When `buildUserTagAffinityVector` would produce a non-empty vector (i.e., listening events exist for tagged tracks), the existing path runs and the histogram is NOT consulted. |
| `computeUserTopTags falls back to histogram when affinity vector is empty` | When the affinity vector is empty (no plays, OR plays only on untagged tracks), `getTagHistogram` is called and its top N tags returned. |
| `computeUserTopTags fallback filters out __untaggable__ sentinel` | When the histogram includes the sentinel row (which it always does once `TagEnrichmentWorker` has hit any unmatched track), the fallback filters it out — the seed loop must never iterate `__untaggable__` as a Last.fm tag. |
| `computeUserTopTags returns empty when histogram is also empty` | Truly-fresh-install case (tag enrichment hasn't run any batch yet). Fallback gracefully returns empty rather than throwing. The `TAG_GRAPH` consumer's existing `if (candidates.isEmpty()) return` guard handles this case correctly. |
| `computeUserTopTags respects the limit on the fallback path` | When the histogram has more than `limit` rows, only the top `limit` are returned. |
| `computeUserTopTags fallback yields `limit` real tags even when `__untaggable__` appears in the histogram top` | Combined-case regression guard. Histogram `[__untaggable__(top), tag1, tag2, …]` with `limit = 10` must yield 10 real tags (the implementation must filter BEFORE take, not AFTER, otherwise the sentinel consumes a slot). The existing implementation chains `.filter { … }.take(limit)`; this test pins that order. |

The first test guards against a regression where the histogram fallback "always runs" — if the listening-affinity signal exists, it should be the source of truth.

Test file: existing `core/data/src/test/kotlin/com/stash/core/data/mix/MixGeneratorTest.kt` if it exists, otherwise `MixGeneratorComputeUserTopTagsTest.kt` as a sibling.

### 3. No schema change

The fallback consumes existing tables (`track_tags`) via an existing DAO method (`TrackTagDao.getTagHistogram()`). No migration. Schema stays at v22.

### 4. Edge cases

#### 4.1 Empty histogram (truly-fresh install)

If both the affinity vector AND the histogram are empty (the user just installed v0.9.19 and `TagEnrichmentWorker` hasn't run a single batch yet), `computeUserTopTags` returns `emptyList()`. `MixSeedGenerator.generateTagGraph(emptyList())` returns `emptyList()`, the worker's `if (candidates.isEmpty()) return` early-exits, and First Listen stays empty. After enrichment runs once, the next refresh produces tags via the fallback. No additional code change needed.

#### 4.2 Histogram polluted with `__untaggable__` only

If every track in the user's library returns `__untaggable__` from Last.fm (vanishingly unlikely — typical Last.fm coverage is high for mainstream tracks), the filter strips them all and the fallback returns `emptyList()`. Same downstream behavior as 4.1.

#### 4.3 Listening-affinity vector becomes non-empty after enrichment catches up

The fallback's `if (vector.isNotEmpty()) return …` short-circuit ensures the affinity-vector path takes over the moment the user has any plays on enriched tracks. No persistent state to flip; the choice is computed per-refresh.

#### 4.4 Daily Discover unaffected

Daily Discover uses `ARTIST_SIMILAR`, which doesn't call `computeUserTopTags`. Untouched.

#### 4.5 Deep Cuts unaffected

Deep Cuts uses `NONE` strategy — short-circuits before the seed-generator dispatch. Untouched.

### 5. Versioning + ship

- `versionCode`: 56 → 57
- `versionName`: 0.9.18 → 0.9.19
- Schema: 22 (unchanged)
- New branch: `feat/first-listen-tag-fallback`, worktree at `.worktrees/first-listen-tag-fallback`. Per project memory: copy `local.properties` AND `keystore.properties` AND `stash-release.jks` into the worktree (`local.properties` for Last.fm credentials at build time; signing files for release-APK install over existing v0.9.18).

## Open questions

None blocking implementation. Possible follow-ups deferred to later releases:

- **Tag-enrichment throughput.** 200 tracks/day on a vast library is slow. Doubling the batch (or adding a "catch-up" mode that runs hourly until the untagged backlog is < N) would reduce the window during which the fallback is the only source of truth. Worth doing if users with >5000 tracks repeatedly ask why their listening history doesn't bias First Listen.
- **Hybrid weighting.** When the affinity vector exists but is *thin* (few plays on enriched tracks), blending with the histogram could produce better signal than either alone. Worth exploring if v0.9.19's binary "vector if present, histogram otherwise" feels sharp at the boundary.
- **Listening events trigger immediate tag-enrichment.** Currently `TagEnrichmentWorker` walks `findUntaggedDownloadedTrackIds` from the top — there's no "prioritize tracks the user is actively playing" signal. A small tweak would re-order the queue to enrich played-but-untagged tracks first. Different bug class; out of scope here.
