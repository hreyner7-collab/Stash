# NewPipe Extractor Spike — Design

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Branch:** `feat/newpipe-extractor-spike` (to be cut from `feat/yt-fallback-resolver`)
**Status:** Spec — pending implementation plan

## Goal

Evaluate whether [TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) can replace yt-dlp + QuickJS as the primary cipher-solving extractor for YouTube preview URLs, by running it as a third arm in the existing `PreviewUrlExtractor` race and measuring on-device latency + success rate via `LATDIAG` logcat keys.

This is a **feasibility spike**, not a feature branch. No demotion of yt-dlp, no UI surface, no settings toggle. The branch is evaluated against LATDIAG data; promotion (or abandonment) happens in a follow-up.

## Context

`PreviewUrlExtractor` (`data/download/src/main/kotlin/com/stash/data/download/preview/PreviewUrlExtractor.kt`) currently races two extractors:

- **InnerTube** (`extractViaInnerTube`, ~1–2 s) — rotates ANDROID_VR → IOS → WEB_REMIX client variants looking for an unciphered `streamingData.adaptiveFormats[*].url`. Concurrency cap 8.
- **yt-dlp + QuickJS** (`extractViaYtDlp`, ~15–35 s) — full signature solving. Slow but reliable. Concurrency cap 2.

Race semantics: sequential preference. InnerTube is awaited first; yt-dlp's result is only used if InnerTube returns null.

The just-shipped YT-fallback resolver (commit `5583e29`, `feat/yt-fallback-resolver`) routes tracks not in Qobuz's catalog through this same path. Empirically (logged via `LATDIAG`), every YT-fallback track pays the full ~11 s yt-dlp + QuickJS cost: an InnerTube probe in `.worktrees/online-streaming-engine` confirmed all three InnerTube variants return ciphered URLs for restricted music. yt-dlp is the only path that produces a playable URL, and 11 s of "tap → audio" latency is the spike's motivating user-visible pain point.

NewPipe Extractor is an established Android library that performs YouTube cipher-solving in-process (Rhino-backed). It does not depend on yt-dlp's Python runtime and typically resolves a stream URL in 1–4 s on the YT-fallback population. The spike adds it as a measurement-instrumented third racer.

## Architecture

The spike adds NewPipe as the middle arm of a three-way preview-URL race, with sequential preference.

```
PreviewUrlExtractor.extractStreamUrl(videoId)
    │
    └─ race(videoId, innerTubeExtract, newPipeExtract, ytDlpExtract,
              itSem, npSem, ytSem)
            │
            ├─ async { innerTubeExtract }  cap=8  rescue→null
            ├─ async { newPipeExtract   }  cap=4  rescue→null   ← new
            └─ async { ytDlpExtract     }  cap=2  throws on fail
            │
            ├─ await inner   → non-null? cancel np+yt, return
            ├─ await newpipe → non-null? cancel yt,    return   ← new
            └─ await yt      → return (or throw)
```

Behavioral contract:

- **Catalog tracks** (InnerTube returns unciphered URL): identical to today. InnerTube wins in ~1–2 s; NewPipe and yt-dlp are cancelled. Zero user-visible change.
- **YT-fallback / restricted tracks** (InnerTube returns null after ~1 s, once it has exhausted variants): NewPipe and yt-dlp both ran in parallel from t=0. When InnerTube punts, the race looks at NewPipe's slot — if NewPipe has already finished with a URL, return immediately; if still pending, await it; if it returned null, fall through to yt-dlp.
- **NewPipe outage** (library bug, YouTube change, network): NewPipe arm returns null, race falls through to yt-dlp exactly as today. No regression possible — yt-dlp remains the correctness backstop.

The new arm is purely additive: every code path that exists today still exists with the same outcome on yt-dlp failure or success. The only new behavior is "NewPipe might return first."

## Components

### `NewPipeStreamExtractor` (new)

Path: `data/download/src/main/kotlin/com/stash/data/download/preview/NewPipeStreamExtractor.kt`

Shape mirrors `YtDlpManager` — `@Singleton`, owns lazy init, exposes one suspend.

```kotlin
@Singleton
class NewPipeStreamExtractor @Inject constructor(
    private val downloader: OkHttpNewPipeDownloader,
) {
    @Volatile private var initialized = false
    private val initLock = Any()

    private fun ensureInitialized() {
        if (initialized) return
        synchronized(initLock) {
            if (initialized) return
            NewPipe.init(downloader, Localization("en", "US"))
            initialized = true
        }
    }

    /** Returns highest-bitrate audio stream URL, or null on any failure. */
    suspend fun extractStreamUrl(videoId: String): String? = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        ensureInitialized()
        val url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$videoId"
        withTimeout(NEWPIPE_TIMEOUT_MS) {
            runCatching {
                val service: StreamingService = ServiceList.YouTube
                val info = StreamInfo.getInfo(service, url)
                info.audioStreams
                    .maxByOrNull { it.averageBitrate.takeIf { b -> b > 0 } ?: it.bitrate }
                    ?.content   // resolved direct URL (NewPipe deciphers internally)
            }.getOrElse { t ->
                if (t is CancellationException) throw t
                Log.w(TAG, "NewPipe extract failed for $videoId: ${t.javaClass.simpleName} ${t.message}")
                null
            }
        }
    }

    companion object {
        private const val TAG = "NewPipeStreamExtractor"
        private const val NEWPIPE_TIMEOUT_MS = 15_000L
    }
}
```

### `OkHttpNewPipeDownloader` (new)

Path: `data/download/src/main/kotlin/com/stash/data/download/preview/OkHttpNewPipeDownloader.kt`

Implements NewPipe's abstract `Downloader.execute(request)` on top of the existing injected `OkHttpClient`. Reusing the shared client inherits timeouts, interceptors, and the connection pool — no second HTTP stack.

```kotlin
@Singleton
class OkHttpNewPipeDownloader @Inject constructor(
    private val client: OkHttpClient,
) : Downloader() {
    override fun execute(request: Request): Response {
        val body = request.dataToSend()?.toRequestBody(null)
        val httpReq = okhttp3.Request.Builder()
            .url(request.url())
            .method(request.httpMethod(), body)
            .apply { request.headers().forEach { (k, vs) -> vs.forEach { v -> addHeader(k, v) } } }
            .build()
        client.newCall(httpReq).execute().use { resp ->
            return Response(
                resp.code, resp.message,
                resp.headers.toMultimap(),
                resp.body?.string(),
                resp.request.url.toString(),
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### `PreviewUrlExtractor` (modified)

- Constructor takes the new `NewPipeStreamExtractor`.
- `race()` companion signature gains `newPipeExtract` + `npSem`.
- New `newPipeSemaphore` field on the companion (cap = `NEWPIPE_CONCURRENCY`).
- `extractStreamUrl` wires the new arm with a `newpipe-end` LATDIAG log and a `winner` field on `extract-end`.

```kotlin
private suspend fun race(
    videoId: String,
    innerTubeExtract: suspend (String) -> String?,
    newPipeExtract:  suspend (String) -> String?,
    ytDlpExtract:    suspend (String) -> String,
    itSem: Semaphore,
    npSem: Semaphore,
    ytSem: Semaphore,
): String = coroutineScope {
    val inner = async { itSem.acquire(); try { rescueNull { innerTubeExtract(videoId) } } finally { itSem.release() } }
    val np    = async { npSem.acquire(); try { rescueNull { newPipeExtract(videoId)  } } finally { npSem.release() } }
    val yt    = async { ytSem.acquire(); try { ytDlpExtract(videoId)                  } finally { ytSem.release() } }

    inner.await()?.let { url ->
        np.cancel(CancellationException("InnerTube won"))
        yt.cancel(CancellationException("InnerTube won"))
        return@coroutineScope url
    }
    np.await()?.let { url ->
        yt.cancel(CancellationException("NewPipe won"))
        return@coroutineScope url
    }
    yt.await()
}
```

`rescueNull` is a small helper factored out of the existing pattern: `runCatching { block() }.getOrElse { if (it is CancellationException) throw it; null }`.

## Dependency injection

All three new types are `@Inject constructor`-eligible. No `@Module` boilerplate needed.

- `OkHttpClient` is already provided as `@Singleton` in `core/network/NetworkModule.kt`. No change.
- `OkHttpNewPipeDownloader` and `NewPipeStreamExtractor` are both `@Singleton` — one instance per process.
- `PreviewUrlExtractor` constructor gains `private val newPipeStreamExtractor: NewPipeStreamExtractor`.

## Init lifecycle

NewPipe's static `NewPipe.init(downloader, localization)` is process-global and only safe to call once. Lazy double-checked-locking inside `NewPipeStreamExtractor.ensureInitialized()`:

- First `extractStreamUrl` call pays the init cost (cheap — registers services, no network).
- Subsequent calls hit the `@Volatile` fast path and skip the lock.
- Init runs on `Dispatchers.IO` because the wrapping `withContext(IO)` is already there.

**No eager init.** `Application.onCreate()` is unchanged. Cold-start cost stays at zero for catalog-only users who never hit the YT-fallback path.

## Operational dials

Constants in `PreviewUrlExtractor.companion object`, discoverable as a single tuning surface alongside the existing dials:

```kotlin
private const val NEWPIPE_TIMEOUT_MS = 15_000L
private const val NEWPIPE_CONCURRENCY = 4
```

**Timeout: 15 s.** Sits between InnerTube (10 s) and yt-dlp (60 s). NewPipe typically responds in 1–4 s; 15 s absorbs slow round-trips and JS-deciphering without competing with yt-dlp's 60 s timeout. Past 15 s, NewPipe is almost certainly broken on this videoId and we want the race to fall through to yt-dlp quickly. Wrapped via `withTimeout` inside `extractStreamUrl`. Timeout failure is rescued as null by the same `runCatching`.

**Concurrency: 4.** Between InnerTube (8) and yt-dlp (2). NewPipe is heavier than InnerTube (own HTTP + JS-deciphering via Rhino) but lighter than yt-dlp (no Python runtime, no JNI surface). 4 lets the prefetcher warm a small queue without saturating the OkHttp pool the rest of the app shares.

**Format selector:** `audioStreams.maxByOrNull { averageBitrate.takeIf { it > 0 } ?: bitrate }`. Matches `extractViaInnerTube` semantics.

**No retry / no variant-rotation.** Single attempt per request. Failure → race falls through to yt-dlp. Internal retry would muddle the latency signal.

## LATDIAG instrumentation

Existing keys stay. One new key plus a `winner` field on `extract-end`:

```
extract-start  videoId=...
innertube-end  videoId=... dt=...ms outcome=url|null|throw:Exception
newpipe-end    videoId=... dt=...ms outcome=url|null|throw:Exception    ← new
ytdlp-end      videoId=... dt=...ms outcome=url|throw:Exception
extract-end    videoId=... dt=...ms winner=innertube|newpipe|ytdlp     ← winner is new
extract-fail   videoId=... dt=...ms err=Exception
```

The `winner` field lets us answer the spike's question with a single `grep "extract-end" | awk` over a session's logcat. Stamped in `extractStreamUrl` by tagging which arm produced the returned URL.

## Build configuration

`data/download/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("com.github.TeamNewPipe:NewPipeExtractor:0.24.6")
```

`settings.gradle.kts` (verify; most yt-dlp-android projects already have it):

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }
}
```

## Tests

Two surfaces. JVM unit tests only — no instrumented/integration tests. On-device LATDIAG numbers are the evaluation signal.

### `PreviewUrlExtractorTest.kt` (extended)

The existing file exercises `raceForTest` against the `TestHooks` interface. Extend `TestHooks` with `suspend fun newPipeExtract(id: String): String?`; existing doubles return `null` (preserves their 2-arm behavior). New cases:

- `newpipe_wins_when_innertube_returns_null_and_newpipe_returns_first` — InnerTube returns null after a delay, NewPipe returns a URL faster than yt-dlp; assert NewPipe's URL is returned and yt-dlp is cancelled.
- `falls_through_to_ytdlp_when_innertube_and_newpipe_both_return_null` — both nullable arms punt; yt-dlp's URL wins.
- `newpipe_throw_does_not_poison_race` — NewPipe throws `RuntimeException`; race still returns yt-dlp's URL. Asserts the `rescueNull` helper catches non-cancellation throws.
- `newpipe_cancellation_propagates` — outer scope is cancelled mid-race; assert NewPipe's permit is released (semaphore `availablePermits` returns to baseline).
- `winner_field_reflects_arm_that_produced_url` — drive each arm to win in turn; assert `raceForTest` reports the right `winner` value. To enable this, `raceForTest` is extended to return `Pair<String, String>` (url, winner) instead of just `String`. The internal `race()` similarly returns the pair so the call site in `extractStreamUrl` can stamp LATDIAG with the value the race produced rather than guessing from outside.

Timing via `runTest` + `advanceTimeBy`, matching the existing file's style.

### `NewPipeStreamExtractorTest.kt` (new)

Pure JVM unit test. Injects a fake `OkHttpNewPipeDownloader`:

- `returns_highest_bitrate_audio_url` — fake Downloader returns canned NewPipe `StreamInfo` JSON with multiple audioStreams; assert the highest-bitrate one is picked.
- `returns_null_on_extractor_exception` — fake Downloader throws / returns malformed JSON; method returns null.
- `returns_null_on_timeout` — fake Downloader delays past `NEWPIPE_TIMEOUT_MS`; method returns null. (Uses `runTest` virtual time.)
- `cancellation_propagates_not_swallowed` — outer scope cancels; method rethrows `CancellationException` rather than swallowing it.

**Spike unknown:** if `NewPipe.init()` fights MockWebServer (touches real network or static state in tests), degrade test #1 to a smaller-scope unit test against the format-selection logic, extracted to `internal fun pickBestAudio(streams: List<AudioStream>): String?`. This is the only "tbd in implementation" in the design.

### Out of scope for tests

- No tests for `OkHttpNewPipeDownloader` directly — thin adapter, covered transitively.
- No tests against real YouTube — CI flakiness without answering the spike's question.

## Out of scope

Explicit non-goals — listed because each is a plausible "while we're in there" expansion that would muddy the data or balloon the diff.

- **No demotion of yt-dlp.** If NewPipe wins consistently, yt-dlp's cap, timeout, and call-site stay unchanged. Demotion is a follow-up branch informed by this spike's LATDIAG numbers.
- **No retry-path integration.** `extractViaYtDlpForRetry` (called by `SearchViewModel.onPreviewError` when ExoPlayer rejects a throttled InnerTube URL) still calls yt-dlp directly. Wiring NewPipe in there is a second data-affecting change; do it after the primary signal lands.
- **No offline-download integration.** Downloads still use yt-dlp's full-file path. NewPipe Extractor only resolves stream URLs.
- **No InnerTube changes.** `playerForAudio` variant rotation untouched.
- **No cookie / auth integration for NewPipe.** Measure the clean-public-track path first. Cookie support is a follow-up if data shows it's needed.
- **No settings-tab exposure / no UI toggle.** Runs unconditionally on the branch. Bad data → abandon the branch, no UI cleanup.
- **No analytics / Sentry events.** LATDIAG via `adb logcat` is sufficient.
- **No eager `Application.onCreate()` init.** Cold start clean; catalog-only users pay zero NewPipe cost.
- **No alternative library evaluation.** Upstream TeamNewPipe 0.24.6 (or latest at branch-cut) — that's the conclusion the data is about.

## Branch posture

`feat/newpipe-extractor-spike` cut from `feat/yt-fallback-resolver` (YT-fallback is the population that benefits most). It's an evaluation branch, not a promotion-ready feature branch. Depending on LATDIAG results, the next action is one of:

- **NewPipe is a clear win** → rebase + ship; queue follow-up branch to demote yt-dlp.
- **NewPipe wins sometimes** → follow-up tuning branch (cookie support? variant rotation? alternative versions?).
- **NewPipe doesn't beat yt-dlp** → close branch without merge; document findings.

## Risks

- **YouTube cat-and-mouse.** NewPipe breaks periodically when YouTube ships extraction-defense changes. yt-dlp remains the backstop — a NewPipe outage degrades to today's behavior, not to a broken app.
- **Rhino size.** NewPipe pulls in Mozilla Rhino for JS execution. APK bloat needs to be measured during implementation; if it's significant (>1 MB), document the trade-off in the evaluation.
- **NewPipe.init() in tests.** Static init may fight JVM unit tests. Mitigation in the test plan above.
- **Cipher-solving via Rhino is single-threaded.** Concurrency 4 may not deliver 4x throughput. If LATDIAG shows queuing delays, drop to 2.

## Spike Results (2026-05-21)

**Verdict: NewPipe v0.24.6 is not viable for the YT-fallback workload. Recommendation — close the branch without merge.**

The cat-and-mouse risk above hit on day one.

### What the data showed

On-device LATDIAG capture across one session of search-tab previews and library plays:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Completed extracts | 8 |
| `winner=newpipe` | **0** |
| `winner=ytdlp` | 8 (dt 10.8–12.2 s) |
| `winner=innertube` | 0 (expected — all tracks were restricted) |
| NewPipe outcomes (raw) | 9 `outcome=null`, 60 `outcome=throw:JobCancellationException` |
| `ContentNotAvailableException` in logcat | 68 |

Every single NewPipe call against YouTube Music's catalog returned `ContentNotAvailableException: The page needs to be reloaded` from `YoutubeStreamExtractor.checkPlayabilityStatus` (`YoutubeStreamExtractor.java:890`). NewPipe's HTML5 client path is being rejected by YouTube for music content at this version of the library.

The cancellations in the raw outcomes are tap-cancel storms from impatient retries during testing — not a NewPipe defect.

### Latency impact: zero

NewPipe fails fast (200–600 ms) and the race transparently falls through to yt-dlp. End-to-end `extract-end dt` on the YT-fallback population stays at 10.8–12.2 s, matching the pre-spike baseline. The three-arm race adds no measurable overhead when NewPipe is the failing arm.

### Adjacent finding (not caused by the spike)

The "20–30 s couldn't find track" symptom observed during testing was triggered by rapid retries: when a user taps another song before the in-flight race finishes, the race is cancelled, yt-dlp's JNI process is left in a half-torn-down state, and the *next* extraction sees `ytdlp-end dt=3ms outcome=throw:YoutubeDLException` from a stale process. When the user finally stops tapping, the last race completes normally at ~11 s. This is a pre-existing yt-dlp robustness issue, not a regression from this branch — but it's an open follow-up worth filing (yt-dlp recovery / debouncing on rapid taps).

### Why NewPipe failed

`ContentNotAvailableException: The page needs to be reloaded` is emitted when YouTube returns a `playabilityStatus` that NewPipe's HTML5-fetcher logic does not have a handler for. Looking at NewPipe's release history, the HTML5 extraction path in 0.24.6 predates several YouTube tightening cycles in early 2026. Newer NewPipe releases (0.24.8, 0.26.x) may have updated parsers, but evaluating them is a separate follow-up branch and out of scope here.

### Follow-up options (not committed by this spike)

- **Close-without-merge (recommended).** Branch is abandoned. The plan + spec live as documentation of what was tried and why.
- **Re-spike on a newer NewPipe release.** If 0.26.x ships a fix for `ContentNotAvailableException` on YouTube Music tracks, the same wiring can be reused — bump the version in `libs.versions.toml`, re-run the LATDIAG session, decide again.
- **yt-dlp recovery hardening (orthogonal).** The tap-cancel `ytdlp-end dt=3ms` failure mode is independent of NewPipe and worth its own branch — either debounce the search-tab tap handler, or stiffen `YtDlpManager` against rapid re-init after a cancelled call.

### Acceptance against spike goal

The goal was: *measure whether NewPipe can replace yt-dlp on the YT-fallback population.* The measurement was conclusive after one session — 0/8 NewPipe wins, 100% `ContentNotAvailableException` failure rate, zero latency improvement. Spike is complete. yt-dlp remains the only path that works for YT-fallback tracks at the libraries pinned here.
