/**
 * Walks Stash's streaming-source roster in priority order and returns
 * the first match. Each resolver internally handles its own enablement
 * (captcha cookies, circuit-breaker state for non-streaming paths, etc.)
 * — null from one resolver just means "try the next one".
 *
 * Current order:
 *   1. [KennyyStreamResolver]  — `kennyy.com.br`, Qobuz lossless. No
 *      captcha gate; almost always usable. Primary source.
 *   2. [QobuzStreamResolver]   — `qobuz.squid.wtf`. Same Qobuz catalog,
 *      requires a user-pasted `captcha_verified_at` cookie. Auto-skipped
 *      when no cookie is set or the current cookie has been marked stale.
 *   3. [YouTubeStreamResolver] — yt-dlp / InnerTube extraction. Last
 *      resort, reached only when the track genuinely isn't in the Qobuz
 *      catalog (Bandcamp re-uploads, region-exclusive, underground
 *      releases). Lossy quality (AAC/Opus ~128-160 kbps), surfaced as a
 *      "via YT" badge in Now Playing so the user knows.
 *
 * Exposes the same `resolve(track) -> StreamUrl?` shape as the individual
 * resolvers so callers ([PlayerRepositoryImpl], [StreamingMediaSourceFactory],
 * [RefreshingDataSourceFactory], [PrefetchOrchestrator]) can swap in by
 * type without changing call-site logic.
 *
 * Result caching is the caller's responsibility — [StreamUrlCache] sits
 * on the player side and stores the first source's success keyed by track
 * id. Subsequent plays of the same track hit the cache and bypass the
 * registry entirely until the URL's `etsp` expires.
 *
 * Test toggle (off for normal use):
 *  - [StreamingPreference.isForceYouTubeFallback]: [resolve] skips Kennyy
 *    and Squid entirely and routes every track through the YouTube resolver
 *    only — reproduces the lossless-down fallback path on demand.

     *   the queue's critical path. Foreground calls leave this true.
