 * after [threshold] consecutive errors with no successful playback or
 * user transport command in between, returns [Verdict.Halt] instead of
 * the usual [Verdict.Recover].
 *
 * Not thread-safe by itself — caller must invoke from the single
 * MediaController callback thread (which is what we already do).
