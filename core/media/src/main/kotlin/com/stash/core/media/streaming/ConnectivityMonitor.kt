/**
 * Thin wrapper around [ConnectivityManager] for the streaming engine's
 * routing decisions in [com.stash.core.media.PlayerRepositoryImpl].
 *
 * Two questions the routing layer asks at every track tap in Online mode:
 *
 *  - **[isConnected]** — is there any network that actually reaches the
 *    public internet? Distinguishes "Wi-Fi captive-portal landing page"
 *    (associated, no validated internet) from a real connection. Driven
 *    by [NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED], which is the
 *    framework's "captive-portal probe passed" signal.
 *  - **[isCellular]** — is the active path a mobile-data transport?
 *    Used together with [com.stash.core.data.prefs.StreamingPreference
 *    .streamOnCellular] to decide whether to refuse a stream rather than
 *    silently burn the user's data plan.
 *
 * Both methods return `false` if there's no active network at all
 * (airplane mode, all transports down) — the routing layer surfaces
 * that as the `NoConnectivity` snackbar reason. Synchronous on purpose:
 * the routing decision tree runs on the IO dispatcher during a
 * suspending tap handler, and a single `getActiveNetwork()` /
 * `getNetworkCapabilities()` call is cheap enough that adding a Flow
 * abstraction would be over-engineering for v1.
 *
 * No `NetworkCallback` subscription here — connectivity state is only
 * sampled at decision time. Future Task: register a callback so the
 * Now Playing screen can surface "lost connection while streaming"
 * before ExoPlayer's read fails.
