 * new mode (e.g. a user-chosen quiet-hours schedule) is added later,
 * one change here propagates everywhere.
 *
 * `setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)` stays on in every mode so an unplugged

/**
 * Constraints for **manual user-initiated triggers** — the user explicitly
 * tapped "Refresh this mix" or the app booted with orphan downloads to
 * drain. They're asking for content right now; the system honors that on
 * whatever network is available.
 *
 * Differs from [constraintsFor]:
 *  - Charging requirement DROPPED (user is actively using the app).
 *  - Network requirement RELAXED from UNMETERED to CONNECTED — manual
 *    triggers don't gate on cellular preference. The user's
 *    DownloadNetworkMode pref still governs the periodic background
 *    cycle (via [constraintsFor]); it doesn't govern foreground intent.
 *
 * `setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)` stays on — a 5% battery + manual
 * refresh is still a bad combination.
 *
 * v0.9.20 history: shipped in PR 5 respecting DownloadNetworkMode for
 * cellular gating. After a corruption-induced pref reset left the user
 * stuck (default mode = WIFI_AND_CHARGING → manual triggers required
 * unmetered → no firing on cellular), we relaxed to CONNECTED to match
 * how every major music app handles user-initiated downloads.
