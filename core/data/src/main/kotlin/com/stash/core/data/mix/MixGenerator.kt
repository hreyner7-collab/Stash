/**
 * Pure materializer for a [StashMixRecipeEntity] — given the recipe and
 * read access to the library, it produces an ordered list of `TrackEntity`
 * rows that the refresh worker writes into the recipe's playlist.
 *
 * ## Scoring model (v0.9.16)
 *
 * Every candidate track is assigned a score that linearly combines:
 *
 *  - **Affinity** (`buildAffinityMap`): in-Stash plays in the last 180
 *    days, log-normalized and exponentially decayed (30-day half-life),
 *    plus a Last.fm cross-source playcount supplement. Recipe's
 *    [StashMixRecipeEntity.affinityBias] shifts the weight:
 *      - positive bias (+) → heavy rotation favorites bubble up
 *      - negative bias (−) → Rediscovery surfaces tracks you *have* liked
 *        but haven't played recently
 *
 *  - **Tag cosine** (`buildTagCosineMap`): cosine similarity between the
 *    track's tag-weight vector and the user's L2-normalized tag-affinity
 *    vector (computed from decayed listening history). Replaces the
 *    older "sum of include-tag weights" heuristic — every recipe now
 *    gets a tag-affinity signal, not just those with explicit tags.
 *
 *  - **Completion** (`buildCompletionMap`): completed-listen ratio over
 *    the last 60 days. Tracks the user habitually finishes get a small
 *    boost; unknown tracks default to 0.5 (neutral).
 *
 *  - **Loved boost**: additive bonus for Last.fm-loved tracks.
 *
 *  - **Skip penalty** (`buildSkipPenaltyMap`): subtracted from the
 *    score when a track's 14-day skip-rate is high (linear ramp from
 *    0.4, full penalty at 0.6+).
 *
 * Freshness is a hard pre-filter (Step 5), not a scoring term — a small
 * jitter is added at sort time so the same score doesn't produce
 * identical ordering day-to-day.
 *
 * ## Discovery slots
 *
 * The recipe's `discovery_ratio` reserves that fraction of the target
 * length for tracks not yet in the library. This generator does NOT fetch
 * those — it only queues candidate entries into [DiscoveryQueueEntity]
 * for the [com.stash.core.data.sync.workers.StashDiscoveryWorker] to
 * resolve asynchronously. If no discovery tracks are ready yet, the
 * library-only portion stretches to fill the mix (users never see an
 * empty-looking mix because discovery didn't finish).
