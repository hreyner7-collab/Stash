     * 50 -> 100 between v0.9.18 and v0.9.19 because ~50 survivors had
     * accumulated). SQLite treats NULL as "smaller than any value" under
     * `DESC`, so any pathological NULL `completed_at` rows fall to the
     * end naturally, but they're already excluded by the status filter
     * since worker DONE transitions stamp the timestamp.

     * track_id no longer points at a live row in `tracks` (deleted by the
     * orphan sweeper, user delete, or stale state from migrations). Without
     * this JOIN, materializeMix's insertCrossRef into playlist_tracks throws
     * SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY because the FK on tracks(id) is enforced.
     *
     * v0.9.20 follow-up: AND t.is_downloaded = 1 ensures the mix never
     * surfaces a stub TrackEntity (a discovery row that was marked DONE
     * by StashDiscoveryWorker but whose file hasn't landed on disk yet).
     * Without this filter, a transient window between StashDiscoveryWorker
     * completion and DiscoveryDownloadWorker completion would put unplayable
     * tracks in the playlist. DiscoveryDownloadWorker fixes the underlying
     * issue (downloads run promptly); this filter is defense-in-depth.
