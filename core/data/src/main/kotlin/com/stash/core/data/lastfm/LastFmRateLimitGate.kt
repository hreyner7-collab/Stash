/**
 * Per-key circuit breaker for Last.fm rate-limit responses (error 29 / HTTP
 * 429). The app spreads read traffic across a pool of API keys; when one key
 * gets throttled, continuing to fire requests at it only prolongs the block,
 * so this breaker fails that key fast — skipping the network — for an
 * exponentially-growing cooldown, while the rest of the pool keeps serving.
 * Each key reopens automatically once its cooldown elapses; a successful
 * response on a key resets its backoff.
 *
 * Time is passed in (`nowMs`) rather than read from the clock so the logic is
 * deterministic and unit-testable.
