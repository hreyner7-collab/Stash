/**
 * Cache-first orchestrator that resolves a non-Spotify (YouTube-pathway) track
 * to a Spotify track URL, so it can subsequently be routed to the antra
 * lossless source (which only accepts an `open.spotify.com/track/<id>` URL).
 *
 * The flow per [resolveUrl] call:
 *  1. Guard: a track with unknown/zero duration can never be scored safely —
 *     return null with NO search and NO cache write.
 *  2. In-flight coalescing: two concurrent resolves of the same uncached
 *     trackId share ONE search (mirrors `AntraStreamResolver`'s
 *     `Mutex`-guarded `HashMap<Long, CompletableDeferred>` owner/joiner).
 *  3. Cache read of the [SpotifyResolutionDao] side-table:
 *     - MATCHED → return the URL form of the stored `spotify:track:<id>` URI.
 *     - NO_MATCH / TRANSIENT still within their TTL → return null (no API call).
 *     - no row, or an expired row → proceed to search.
 *  4. Search Spotify, score with [SpotifySearchScorer], and cache the outcome:
 *     - accepted → MATCHED (permanent).
 *     - empty / no passer → NO_MATCH (30-day TTL).
 *     - 429 / IO / other error → TRANSIENT (backoff TTL, attempts++), with a
 *       promotion to NO_MATCH once attempts exceed [MAX_TRANSIENT_ATTEMPTS].
 *
 * Correctness intent: NEVER poison the cache with a permanent NO_MATCH on a
 * transient failure (rate limit / network blip) — those are TRANSIENT so the
 * track gets retried once the backoff window elapses.
