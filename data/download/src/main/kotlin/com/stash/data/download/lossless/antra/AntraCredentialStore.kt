/**
 * Holds the credentials Stash uses to authenticate against

 *
 * antra gates downloads behind two cookies the user obtains in a browser:
 *
 *  - `session`      — issued after logging in to the antra site.
 *  - `cf_clearance` — issued after passing Cloudflare's challenge.
 *
 * Both must be present for a request to authenticate, so [isConnected]
 * is true only when each cookie is non-blank. The persistence itself
 * lives on [LosslessSourcePreferences] (the shared DataStore-backed prefs
 * the squid captcha cookie also uses), so credentials survive process
 * restarts; this class is the thin domain wrapper that derives the
 * "connected?" state and the ready-to-send Cookie header from them.
 *
 * Nothing calls this yet — the antra source/auth flow lands in later
 * tasks. This is the credential store only.
