/**
 * Wire models for the amz.squid.wtf JSON API (an Amazon Music proxy).
 *
 * We model only the fields the matcher and resolver consume; everything
 * else (lyrics, composer, copyright, label, track_number, …) falls
 * through under the lenient parser's `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` and
 * disappears silently. Anything not guaranteed by the live API is
 * nullable or defaulted so a wire-shape drift degrades to safe
 * zero/null values rather than failing deserialisation — what we want
 * for a third-party reverse-engineered API.
 *
 * NOTE: the `/api/track` response has NO duration field — none is
 * modelled here. Duration must be obtained post-download via the
 * audio extractor, not from this API.
