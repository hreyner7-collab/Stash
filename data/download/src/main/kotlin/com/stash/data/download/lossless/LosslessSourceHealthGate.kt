/**
 * Per-source content-health gate. When a source is observed serving a
 * degraded URL (preview sample / lossy downgrade — see [LosslessUrlInspector])
 * it is marked degraded for [COOLDOWN_MS], so subsequent resolves skip it
 * cheaply instead of paying a wasted round-trip per track.
 *
 * **Independent per source** — kennyy and squid share a leaked Qobuz app_id
 * so they often degrade together, but they recover independently (observed
 * 2026-06-04: squid recovered while kennyy stayed 401). Coupling would
 * wrongly keep a recovered source disabled, so each id has its own entry.
 *
 * **Passive recovery** — when the cooldown lapses the source is simply
 * retried by the next real resolve; if it's still degraded the inspector
 * re-marks it. No dedicated canary track is needed because the inspector
 * rejects a degraded recovery attempt before the user ever sees it. This is
 * the content-health layer; Kennyy's network-health
 * [com.stash.core.media.streaming.KennyyHealthMonitor] is separate and
 * unchanged.
 *
 * The injectable [nowMs] clock keeps this fully unit-testable; Hilt uses the
 * no-arg secondary constructor (System time).
